''' method read() in file
read([size]) : Reads in the entire file if you leave the parentheses empty.
    If you specify a size inside the parentheses, it reads that many characters
    (for a text file) or that many bytes (for a binary file).to	read.If	the	
    argument is -1, the	files must be read to the end.Also if no argument is given,
    the	default	is takent as -1. If the content	of the file is larger than the
    memory then only the content which can fit into the memory will be read.
    Moreover, when the read operation ends a ""(an empty string) is returned.	

readline() : Reads one line of content from a text file (the line ends wherever
    thereâ€™s a newline character).

readlines() : Reads all the lines of a text file into a list. 

readline() and readlines() are useful only for text files.

'''
 seek() method allows you to reposition the pointer. 
    The syntax is: file.seek(position[,whence])
    0: Set position relative to the start of the file.
    1: Set position relative to the current pointer position.
    2: Set position relative to the end of the file. Use a negative number for position
    If you omit the whence value, it defaults to zero.
tell() function	returns the position of the cursor.
